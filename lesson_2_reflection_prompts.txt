What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You tel git that there is where it will have to start recording the commits that you will create. Whitout git init that will only be a normal directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ithink that offers the perfect safe place for your files that you chose to change but are not yet in the finale state to be commited in the repository.
